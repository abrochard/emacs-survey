      <h2>Questions</h2>
      <p>For reference, this was <a href="emacs-user-survey-2020.org">the survey questions</a> in org-mode format.</p>
      <h2>Data</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="Emacs-User-Survey-2020-raw.csv">Raw data</a>
          <ul>
            <li>the reconciled data from both webform and email submissions</li>
            <li>absolutely no change made aside from a few instances where PII and email addresses were redacted</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="Emacs-User-Survey-2020-clean.csv">Cleaned up data</a><br>
          It might get updated in the future, but right now it was derived from the raw data in a best-effort attempt:
          <ul>
            <li>removed negative years in "For how many years have you been using Emacs?"</li>
            <li>unified responses for "How did you hear about this survey?" as Hacker News, Emacs China and Emacs News weren't part of the options</li>
            <li>unified responses for "Which theme do you use?", especially around spelling</li>
            <li>general cleanup and unified of responses which only differed by punctuation and casing</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Statistics about the survey</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>7344 total responses across webform & email
          <ul>
            <li>7240 webform responses</li>
            <li>103 emails</li>
          </ul>
          <img src="submissions-medium.svg">
        </li>
        <li>30% of webform submissions were on mobile device</li>
        <li>average webform completion time was 11 minutes</li>
        <li>
          survey opening announcement trending to the top 100 of Hacker News generated a sudden spike in submissions

      </ul>
      <h2>Analysis</h2>
      <p>There is a lot of data to look at in many different ways. For now, I performed a simple question-by-question analysis using a <a href="https://github.com/abrochard/emacs-survey/blob/main/2020/Emacs%20User%20Survey%202020.ipynb">Jupyter Notebook</a>.</p>
      <p>Also, since free text was available for most questions, it can be hard to categorize some of the results. For multiple choice questions, I did a best effort attempt to bundle responses with low cardinality into an "other" section, which can get quite big in some cases! I also did not attempt to graph anything for pure free text questions. I encourage anyone who is curious to inspect the full responses, either in the notebook or looking at the data directly. The omitted free text questions are:
        <ul>
          <li>If you use org-mode, for what purpose?</li>
          <li>Do you use a language server with lsp-mode or eglot? With what languages?</li>
          <li>Do you use an Emacs debugger interface? What do you use? (Gdb, dap-mode etc)</li>
          <li>What are some of the Emacs improvements you are the most interested in?</li>
          <li>What do you think are Emacs' greatest strengths?</li>
          <li>Can you recall any difficulties you faced initially learning Emacs?</li>
          <li>What is the one thing you would like Emacs to do differently?</li>
          <li>If there is another survey in 2021, would you be opposed to it containing optional & general demographics questions?</li>
          <li>Do you have a preferred platform for filling out the survey in the future?</li>
          <li>Do you have general feedback about the survey process?</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
